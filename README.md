## Description  
This repository contains a workflow for predicting the quality of a wine based on its chemical properties. </br>

The following steps are part of the process : 
<li>Data download using Kaggle API
<li>Exploratory Data Analysis and data preprocessing
<li>Synthetic data generation (optional)
<li>Feature engineering
<li>Neural network for wine quality prediction.  

This project explores the use of **neural network for regression analysis**. While it can also be approached as a classification task, the class distribution is highly imbalanced.

## Installation  
To run this project locally, follow these steps:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dha-code/Wine_quality_prediction.git
cd Wine_quality_prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
---

## Usage

The code uses the [Wine dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/wine-quality-dataset/data) downloaded from Kaggle (also present within the ./data folder).</br>

The graphs and images generated by the code are stored in ./figures. The model is stored as a .pkl file in ./data

   ```python
   python main.py
   ```

If the user wishes to augment the real dataset with synthetic data :

   ```python
   python main.py --synthetic
   ```
